Error: This expression has type
         ('a -> (int * int list) list) -> 'a -> (int * int list) list
       but an expression was expected of type
         ('a -> (int * int list) list) -> 'a -> 'a -> (int * int list) list
       Type (int * int list) list is not compatible with type
         'a -> (int * int list) list
